# Self Critique:
I think the end result was real good, as a team we knocked out the list of things to implement from the professor. We made sure the site is validated and gave it to users to test. I really think our color scheme sets us apart from everyone else and the collapsible tables look real good on mobile. I'm pleased with my teams efforts.
